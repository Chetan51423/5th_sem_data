1) 3 axis accelerometer
2) 3 axis gyroscope
3) onboard digital motion processor (DMP)
   - it is based on MEMS 
   - (micro electro mechanical system)
   - MEMS changes the voltage as change in position 
4) board uses I2C protocol
5) on board voltage reulator



5) 8 pin 
  - VCC and GND
  - SCL and SDA ( Serial data and serial clock---it is use by I2C module to control I2C bus lines)
  - XDA nad XCL (auxilary serial pins)
  - ADO  (Address select b/w auxilary and primary pins)
  - int
