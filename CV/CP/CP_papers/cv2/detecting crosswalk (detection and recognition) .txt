detecting crosswalk (detection and recognition)


detection
 
- adaptive histogram equalization
     -- use to increase the contrast and sharpening of image 
     -- image converted to binary image ---using Otsu,s method
     -- morphology and flood fill is applied to an Image to extract the largest candidate object
     -- edge of latgesgt candidate object is 
- flood fill operation
- Hough transforms


recognition 

- Uniform local binary pattern 
- SVm classifier
