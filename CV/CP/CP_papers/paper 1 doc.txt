color space :-

HSI and RGBB color spaces
Hue saturation color space features 
HSV color model ---- this color model remap RGB color model into more human friendly propoetion

HSV model
 -- H ->represents the color swaps in the image
    S ->represents the proportion of current color integrity (0 to 1)
    V - indicates the image brightness

In Hue - saturation value color space 
    V - is mostly fixed
    H and S - changes only
     
    Therefore it has better illumination flexibility whenever the conditions change. The
    processing complication is also less, which is favorable for segmentation for traffic
    sign detection

1) LeNet-5 CNN Model
   - due to the drawbacks of this model they have to modify the model to extended version 
   - they added the advantages of COnv.NN model in graphics identification.
2) Extended LeNet-5 CNN Model
