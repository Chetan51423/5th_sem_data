Preprocessing:

Apply adaptive histogram equalization to improve the contrast and sharpness of the image if the intensity value is less than a threshold value.
Convert the preprocessed image to binary using Otsu's method.
Morphological and flood fill operations:
Apply morphological operations and flood fill operation to extract the largest candidate object from the binary image.

Edge detection:

Detect edges using the canny operator.
Elimination of vertical edges:
Eliminate vertical edges using four connected method.

Filtering small edges:

Filter out small edges using statistical threshold procedure.
Estimation of potential longest horizontal edges:
Estimate potential longest horizontal edges from the remaining edges.


Hough transform:


Apply Hough transform to detect potential parallel horizontal edges and draw Hough lines.

ROI detection:

Detect the zebra-crossing region of interest (ROI) from the Hough lines.
Feature extraction and classification:
Extract features from the detected ROI using LBP feature extraction technique.
Train an SVM classifier on the extracted features.
Apply the SVM classifier to recognize the zebra-crossing region in the detected ROI.

Performance evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods.
