detecting crosswalk (detection and recognition)


detection
 
- adaptive histogram equalization
     -- use to increase the contrast and sharpening of image 
     -- image converted to binary image ---using Otsu,s method
     -- morphology and flood fill is applied to an Image to extract the largest candidate object
     -- edge of latgest candidate object are detected by utilizing the canney operator.
     -- elemination verticle edges (using 4 connected method and filtering the small edges using statistical threshold procedure)
     -- drawing the hough line on detected / justified 
- flood fill operation
- Hough transforms


recognition 

- Uniform local binary pattern 
   -- rotational invariant uniform local binary pattern is utilized to 
extract the features of candidate region

- SVm classifier
    -- svm classifier is applied to detect ROI to recognised crosswalk.
